This class handles the main WebSocket connection for each user.
It manages two key real-time features:
1.  **Personal Notifications:** Receiving pop-up messages (like "You matched!")
2.  **Presence:** Tracking who is currently online and broadcasting
    updates (for the green online dots).
RT: This entire class handles real-time notifications and user presence updates.
