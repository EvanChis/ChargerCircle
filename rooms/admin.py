This class customizes how the 'Session' model appears in the
Django admin site. It specifically lists the topic, course,
host, and creation time in the main list view. It also attempts
to make all fields editable, although Django might override this
for automatically set fields like 'created_at'.

    # including the auto-timestamp, editable in the detail view. or it's supposed to maybe at least

This block of code makes the main database tables for the
